This project is an online calculator for daily carbon footprint output for a household. We did some online research on how to
calculate carbon footprints, and turned it into a happy, friendly online calculator that also includes some information about
how carbon footprints impact the environment.

This project was made during the Digitize Hackathon sometime in October 2018.
